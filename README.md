# Exploring React hooks
There are only four main hooks that I'm interested in, and used in this little app-like example. Explored all the other hooks as well but as of yet doesn't got on a situation where I've to use them, so... in the app I'm only using the ones that I'm interested in for now and they are `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and `useReducer`.
